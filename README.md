# gs-test-scripts
Test scripts to elucidate the behavior of various programming languages, libraries and frameworks.

### Motivation
1. Create a central repository for all of my test-scripts so I never have to ask the same question twice.
2. Bootstrap the creation of new test-scripts to reduce the amount of time I have to spend digging through documentation or writing these from scratch.

### Organization
1. Each script with exist within a single directory for the programming language in which it is written.
2. The header of each script will describe the goal/problem at hand and will offer a description of its findings.
3. Ideally, the header will also contain any relevant versioning information, the date of the most recent test and the name of the author.

### Contribution
If by some chance someone stumbles onto this repository, feel free to contribute! Just make sure your give your script a descriptive name that doesn't clash with others.
